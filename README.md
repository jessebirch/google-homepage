This is a project for an Odin Project course I am taking. In this specific project I will be deconstructing google's own website.

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

#Final Thoughts from project:

The intention of this assignment was to learn about arranging and placing objects on a website using HTML and CSS. I learned quite a bit about how to arrange items using Flexbox in conjunction with floating items, aligning items, and using the DIV tags in html to group different parts of a website together. I did lose focus a few times when I tried to figure out small visual decorations that Google implements on their page, but I quickly reminded myself what the assignment was and stuck to getting correct placement.

I read a bit about the Grid method in CSS but did not utilize this tech for this project. I did want to get up to speed about what is currently used (flex, float, etc.) before moving onto something newer like grid. Though I do plan on mastering grid going forward.
